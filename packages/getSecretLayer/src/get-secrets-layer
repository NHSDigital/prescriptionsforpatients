# This script is used to coordinate the creation of environmental variables by using a Golang executable
# that is part of the same layer.  In order for this layer to operate, it must have permissions to
# retrieve data from Secrets Manager.
# 
# Please note, this example uses AWS Lambda environmental variables.  This includes the ARN of the Secret
# to use, the region to pull the Secret from, and the ARN for the role to use to retrieve the Secert.
#
# To use this script, make sure that it is wrapped in a ZIP file along with the go-retrieve-secret
# Golang executable and added as a Lambda Layer.  Your Lambda must reference this script by setting the
# AWS_LAMBDA_EXEC_WRAPPER environmental variable to /opt/get-secrets-layer (the name of this shell script)
# and by referencing this layer within it's configuration.
