    ## Overview
    Use this API to retrieve prescriptions data for individual patients from the [Electronic Prescription Service (EPS)](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/electronic-prescription-service-fhir).

    For use in patient-facing applications such as NHS App, to allow patients to view their digital prescriptions.

    Patients can use their digital prescriptions to collect their medication at any pharmacy in England.
    Patients will be able to view:
    * repeat and acute prescriptions created using the [Electronic Prescription Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/electronic-prescription-service-fhir)
    * information about the pharmacy their prescriptions can be collected from or will be delivered by
    * limited information about the status of their prescriptions

    ## Who can use this API
    Currently, this API is for [internal use only](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses) - the only API consumer is the NHS App.

    It is not currently available for integration by external third parties.

    ## Related APIs
    The following APIs are related to this API:
    * [Electronic Prescriptions Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/electronic-prescription-service-fhir): The national service for creating and dispensing prescriptions across health and social care.
    * [Personal Demographics Service](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/api-catalogue/personal-demographics-service-fhir): the national service for storing and retrieving NHS patient details such as name, address, date of birth, related people, registered GP and NHS number.

    ## API status and roadmap
    This API is in an [internal private beta](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#statuses), meaning the API is not currently available for integration by external third parties.

    If you want to use this API when it becomes available for external use, contact us at epsonboarding@nhs.net to register your interest.

    ## Service Level
    This API is a silver service, meaning it is operational and supported between 8am and 6pm, Monday to Friday, but not bank holidays.
    For more details, see [service levels](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#service-levels)

    ## Technology
    This API is [RESTful](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#basic-rest).

    It conforms to the [FHIR](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/our-api-technologies#fhir) global standard for health care data exchange, specifically to [FHIR UK Core](https://digital.nhs.uk/services/fhir-uk-core).

    It includes some country-specific FHIR extensions, which are built against [FHIR UK Core, specifically [UKcore.stu1 0.5.1](https://simplifier.net/packages/fhir.r4.ukcore.stu1/0.5.1).

    You do not need to know much about FHIR to use this API. The API only supports GET requests and the responses will be FHIR.

    FHIR APIs are just RESTful APIs that follow specific rules. In particular:
    * resource names are capitalised and singular, for example `/Bundle` not `/bundle`
    * array names are singular, for example `line` not `lines` for address lines
    * data items that are country-specific and thus not included in the FHIR global base resources are usually wrapped in an `extension` object

    There are [libraries and software development kits available](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/api-technologies-at-nhs-digital#fhir-libraries-and-sdks) to help with FHIR API integration.

    ## Network access
    This API is available on the internet.

    For more details see [Network access for APIs](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/network-access-for-apis).

    ## Security and authorisation
    This API is [user-restricted](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation#user-restricted-apis), meaning an end user must be present, authenticated and authorised.

    The end user must be:
    * a patient who receives health and social care or makes use of NHS services
    * strongly authenticated to a P9 level, using [NHS login - separate authentication and authorisation](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/security-and-authorisation/user-restricted-restful-apis-nhs-login-separate-authentication-and-authorisation)

    To use this API, use the following security pattern:

    ## Errors
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:

    * 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
    * 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
    * 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server

    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://digital.nhs.uk/developer/guides-and-documentation/reference-guide#http-status-codes) for more on errors.
