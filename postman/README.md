# Setting up Postman
Some instructions on getting the Postman collection working to call the [prescriptionsforpatients](https://github.com/NHSDigital/prescriptionsforpatients) API.

## Import the collection
In Postman click the Menu, then File, Import, and select the file: `prescriptionsforpatients\postman\prescriptions_for_patients.postman_collection.json` from the Repo.

__NB: It is possible to import directly from GitHub too.__


## Setting up Environments
It makes sense to have a separate environment for Sandbox and Internal Dev, so you need to create two Environaments.

### For Sandbox
In Postman select Environments on the Sidebar and create a new Environment. Rename the Environment to something obvious and add the following variables:

| Name          | Value                                                  |
| :---          |    :----:                                              |
| host          | internal-dev-sandbox.api.service.nhs.uk                |
| client_id     | [ Get this from your App settings in Apigee Non Prod ] |
| client_secret | [ Get this from your App settings in Apigee Non Prod ] |

### For Internal Dev
In Postman select Environments on the Sidebar and create a new Environment. Rename the Environment to something obvious and add the following variables:

| Name          | Value                                                  |
| :---          |    :----:                                              |
| host          | internal-dev.api.service.nhs.uk                        |
| client_id     | [ Get this from your App settings in Apigee Non Prod ] |
| client_secret | [ Get this from your App settings in Apigee Non Prod ] |

## Request a Token
In Postman select Collections, expand the prescriptions for patients collection, select the __Bundle__ request.

Ensure you have selected the appropriate Environment created above.

Select the Authorization tab, scroll right to the bottom and click __Get New Access Token__

You will be prompted by NHS LOGIN MOCK INTERNAL DEV for a `Username or email`, enter one of the NHS Numbers taken from the list provided [here](https://nhsd-confluence.digital.nhs.uk/display/APM/Testing+with+mock+auth#Testingwithmockauth-NHSLogintestusers).

Make sure to click the Use Token button.

## Submit a request

You can now Send your request to __Bundle__ and should get back the appropriate response.
